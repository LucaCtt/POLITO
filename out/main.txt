Abstract
This thesis explores the design and implementation of a Digital Twin (DT) for a green smart home, integrating
End-User Development (EUD) with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. EUD approaches enable users to control
and manage their Internet of Things (IoT) environments (Barricelli et al., 2019), e.g. using trigger-action
routines created through Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Apple Home applications. In the current era of
IoT, the creation of automatic behaviors like routines may have a significant potential to develop effective
energy management systems for homes. Furthermore, IoT can be combined with ML algorithms to create a DT,
which is a powerful tool for modeling and optimizing complex systems.
The DT developed in this thesis enhances energy consumption awareness by allowing users to monitor the
energy consumption of smart appliances throghout the day and simulate scenarios related to the creation of
routines. These simulations assess the effects of the activation of appliances involved in the routines and
potentially modify them to save energy based on the DT’s suggestions.
The DT is implemented as a Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API)
that exposes endpoints for accessing and manipulating the data and routines of the smart home, displaying the
energy consumption of the appliances over time, and simulating the effects of adding new routines and resolving
potential conflicts with the existing ones. The API separates the DT logic from the user interface, enabling the
DT to be integrated with various clients. A web frontend was also developed to showcase the functionalities of
the DT. The functionality of the DT is based on a list of appliances in the home with the supported operation
modes (e.g., washing modes for a washing machine, or on/off for a lamp), along with a set of routines which
activate the appliances to certain operation modes at specific times during the day.
An hypothetical home was designed as a starting point for the creation of the DT, containing appliances
extracted from the GREEND1 (Monacchi et al., 2014) and UK-DALE2 (Kelly & Knottenbelt, 2015) power consumption datasets. These datasets were selected through a scoping review among power consumption datasets
available in the literature, because of the large number of appliances gathered in European households they
provide. This is important to minimize geographic variations in appliance usage patterns and to produce results
that are relevant for Italian households. The selected datasets however do not record the operation mode of
appliances. For example, a washing machine could be in a certain wash program at a given time, which has a

specific duration and energy requirement. This information is required to assign a specific energy consumption
value to the operation modes and to estimate their duration.
This limitation is overcome with an approach inspired by Castangia et al., 2023, which suggests using unsupervised deep learning techniques to cluster appliance operation modes from a learned, latent state representation
of the raw data. Figure 1 illustrates the main steps of the approach. First, a segmentation procedure is applied
to the raw appliance data to identify the active states that contain the actual power signatures of the device.
These signatures are then standardized and fed to a deep autoencoder model, which learns to reconstruct the
operation cycles and encode them into a latent representation. Next, a K-means clustering algorithm is applied
to the latent representation, to group the operation cycles into different programs of the device. Finally, the
clusters are mapped to the operation modes of the appliance.
The DT uses the identified operation modes and the user-defined routines to create a state matrix of the smart
home throughout the day. Figure 2 shows an example of a state matrix, displaying the operation modes of
the appliances in the hypothetical home throughout the day, based on a predefined set of routines. When a
user wants to create a new routine to manage their appliances, the DT allows them to simulate what would
happen in case of its activation, by returning different types of feedback associated with different scenarios. The
state matrix makes it straightforward to simulate the addition of a new automation and check if any previously
mentioned scenarios occur. The process starts by creating a copy of the current state matrix and by updating
it with the new appliance states of the automation under creation. During simulation, the following conflict
scenarios may happen:
• The power consumption exceeds the energy meter load capacity: the routine can not be executed because
it includes an appliance activation that will bring the total energy consumption over the maximum load
capacity for the energy meter (in Italy it is commonly set to 3kWH for domestic use). The DT provides
suggestions on how the automation could be modified. For example, its activation could be postponed
after an appliance involved in another automation has completed its operation;
• Inconsist operation modes: the automation under creation includes the activation of an appliance in a
given operation mode (e.g., for a washing machine, a short sports cycle), but there is another automation
scheduled on the same appliance with a different operation mode in an overlapping time slot. The DT
may present the user with different options: the deletion of one of the two conflicting automations or the
modification of one of them;
• No conflict, but a suggestion to be more sustainable: the DT may suggest reducing energy consumption
costs, avoiding cases of non-sustainable appliance activation. The DT also looks for the best activation
time slot for the automation, taking into account the energy cost of starting the automation at every

This research is significant as it contributes to the development of a new paradigm for smart and sustainable
living, and advances both theoretical and practical knowledge of DTs in the building sector.
