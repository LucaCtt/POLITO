\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Why do you want to complete further research in this field?}

    I want to research ways to apply ML techniques in innovative ways, to solve real-world problems that could provide a benefit to society as a whole, such as improving quality of life, increasing energy susteinability, and address complex societal challenges. I first discovered this passion while working on my master's thesis, with the title "Study and Development of a Digital Twin for the Simulation of User-Created Automations in a Green Smart Home". In this thesis, I developed a digital twin that tracks and provides suggestions on how to reduce the energy consumption of appliances in a home, based on user-defined automations acting on appliances. The system can be used to increase user's comfort and improve sustainability. The work of my thesis also contributed to a conference paper and a journal article, giving me the opportunity to be involved first-hand in the publication process.

    \item \textbf{Why have you chosen to apply to this particular university?}

    I have chosen the Politecnico di Torino because I believe it represents the ideal convergence of my academic pursuits, professional experiences, and personal ambitions. The renowned faculty, cutting-edge research facilities, and collaborative environment at the Politecnico di Torino provide the perfect backdrop for my aspirations.
